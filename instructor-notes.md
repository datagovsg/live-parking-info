# General tips for presenters

- It is common behaviour for participants to start typing and copying whatever the instructor starts typing on screen. In doing so, they end up not listening. Be explicit with participants when they should simply listen and when they need to type along / copy.
- Repeat things twice. People don't get you the first time. 
- Don't forget that you are teaching something very foreign to them. Be patient and mindful of it.
- Explain even the simplest of things, like === and the difference between ) and }
- Toggle between the final product and the current product so that they know how what you're building is contributing to the final product
- Make sure you highlight the code changes you have made
- Don't answer questions about technical stuff with more jargon than before
- encourage copy pasting so that they don't make tiny mistakes with spelling and stuff
- it's good to start slow. It helps people understand and not get lost too early, which can lead to disengagement
- practice at least twice, preferably with a real audience, before you actually teach. It'll help you remove any jargon that you still invariably use


# General tips for trainers
- Avoid comandeering the participants keyboard. Guide them through what they need to do by pointing and speaking through the steps.
- open up the console. The error is usually there. Look at the line number, the line above it, and the line below it.
- common errors include:
  - mistaken casing (getElementByID instead of getElementById)
  - mistaken spelling (background-colour instead of background-color)
  - mistaken characters (using round brackets instead of curly brackets)
  - missing closing brackets
  - missing closing quotation marks
    

# General tips for running the course
- Have trainers dedicated to each table. They build rapport with the students. Provide time for them to do introductions in the beginning so that they feel comfortable enough asking questions to each other.
- Create table islands so that people get to know each other on that table.
